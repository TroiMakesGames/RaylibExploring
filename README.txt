In order to compile a target .cpp file the correct environment terminal and command links must be used

---------- SINGLE FILE COMPILE TO .EXE ----------

1. Open MSYS2 MINGW64    (a terminal/app that should be found in windows app search)

2. move to the working directory of the target .cpp file
	2.1 writing "cd " and then drag-and-dropping the file from the file explorer will automaticaly fill in the path to the file from root C:\\
	2.2 if not using the 2.1 trick in order to move from the starting msys2 mingw64 directory you can also do "cd C://" to move to root C:\\

3. run this command (replace <name> with the name of the target .cpp file and the desired output .exe name)  "g++ <name>.cpp -o <name>.exe -lraylib -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm"

a <name>.exe file will be generated in the same folder as the target <name>.cpp file is located
